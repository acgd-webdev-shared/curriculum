goal:
  before: |
    Make your website work well in all the browsers—remember it [doesn’t have to look exactly the same](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/), but it should be functional.

    *After fixing all the bugs in your website you’ll be taking screenshots of the final website and posting them to an Issue on GitHub.*

  notes:
    - label: "Collaboration"
      text: |
        This is collaborative. You personally don’t own all the devices you need to test your website on, but as a class you have all the devices.

        **Work together to find out who has what device and with whom you can get your website tested.**

steps:
  - title: "Determine the available devices"
    before: |
      Referring to the [browser testing checklist](/topics/browser-testing-checklist/), figure out what devices—and versions—need to be tested.

      *Poll the class to see who has what version available and make sure as many devices and versions are covered as possible.*

      **Make a list on the board of what person has what browser and what version.**

  - title: "Test your website"
    before: |
      Work together with your classmates to get your website tested in all the browsers available in the classroom.

      **You could assign versions to people and get them to look at everybody’s website in their assigned browser—taking screenshots and discussing errors as they go.**

  - title: "Fix problems"
    before: |
      If there are any problems with your website in a specific browser—fix them.

      **Remember that your website [doesn’t have to look exactly the same in every browser](http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/), but it should be functional and not look broken.**

  - title: "Save screenshots"
    before: |
      After testing your website and everything looks good—take a screenshot of it.

      Upload that screenshot to an Issue on GitHub named “Browser Testing”—in your repository.

      **Do not create an issue in my repository—create the issue in *your* forked repo.** If your repo doesn’t have and Issues tab, go to Settings and turn it on.

      ### Screenshot list

      At an absolute minimum, there should be screenshots for at least these browsers. *They’ll definitely be available in the class among your peers or easily installed.*
