      ## How it works

      **Completely anonymous—ask any question you want.**

      1. Everybody gets a blank index card
      2. Write (neatly) any questions you have
      3. Bring your index card to the front, placing it upside down on the table (even if you don’t have questions)
      4. The teacher will shuffle the cards well
      5. The teacher will answer each question
