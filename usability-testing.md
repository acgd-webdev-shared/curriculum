goal:
  before: |
    We don’t know our product or website is usable until a user uses it. Just because we think a product works doesn’t mean that it actually works well.

    ### [Refer to the usability testing checklist ➔](/topics/usability-testing-checklist/)

  notes:
    - label: "Collaboration"
      text: |
        This is collaborative. You will facilitate user tests with classmates who have no knowledge of your product.

steps:
  - title: "Determine the testing scenarios"
    before: |
      Determine what flows, scenarios & parts of your website that need to be tested.

      *If you’re working on a team, assign different team members ownership of different flows and scenarios.*

  - title: "Set up the testing environment"
    before: |
      If you’re testing in a mobile situation get a phone ready. If you’re testing a desktop scenario set up a laptop with the necessary screen ready.

      *Make sure the starting screen is ready when you user sits down to test. And reset it after each test.*

  - title: "Observe all user tests"
    before: |
      Remember not to guide or help your users: you want to see them struggle and find the friction of your user tests.

      Run your users through as many flows and scenarios as are important to your application.

      *Collect observations and feedback from your users using the standard [**usability testing document**](/topics/usability-testing-checklist/).*

  - title: "Submitting Issues"
    before: |
      Create an Issue for each usability friction or hurdle. Assign these issues to the proper labels, people & sprints.

  - title: "Fix problems"
    before: |
      All the areas of friction should be fixed before continuing. **If you need to do another testing session to determine smoothness do so.**
